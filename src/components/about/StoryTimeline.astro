        How Britanni AI Started

        It started with a simple frustration. Jack and Brittany Brighenti were managing dozens of real estate transactions each year, and the coordination work was crushing. Every deal meant tracking a dozen deadlines, chasing five different parties for updates, and praying nothing fell through the cracks. When something did — a missed disclosure or a late EMD — the fallout was always expensive.

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        Hiring a human transaction coordinator helped, but at $300–$500 per deal, the cost added up fast. And even the best TCs had limits — they worked business hours, handled one thing at a time, and still relied on manual processes that left room for error.

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        That's when Brandon Levine entered the picture. With deep expertise in AI systems and enterprise automation, Brandon saw what Jack and Brittany were describing not as an unsolvable headache, but as a perfect problem for AI. The coordination work was structured, rule-based, and communication-heavy — exactly the kind of work an intelligent system could handle better than any human, at a fraction of the cost.

      <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
        Together, the three co-founders set out to build the tool they wished existed: an AI transaction coordinator that could analyze contracts in seconds, track every deadline automatically, and communicate with every party at precisely the right time. They named it Britanni — and their mission became clear: give every agent access to world-class transaction coordination, regardless of budget.
