If you've been in real estate for more than a few months, you've probably heard the term "transaction coordinator" — or TC for short. Maybe you've used one. Maybe you've thought about hiring one. Or maybe you've been doing all the coordination yourself and wondering if there's a better way.

There is. But first, let's break down what a TC actually does and why it matters.

## What Does a Transaction Coordinator Do?

A transaction coordinator is the person (or, increasingly, the software) responsible for managing the administrative and compliance work behind every real estate deal. From the moment a purchase agreement is signed to the day of closing, a TC handles:

- **Contract review and audit** — checking for missing signatures, incomplete addenda, and unsigned disclosures
- **Deadline tracking** — monitoring every critical date including inspection periods, financing contingencies, and closing deadlines
- **Communication management** — sending emails and updates to buyers, sellers, co-op agents, lenders, and title companies
- **Document coordination** — collecting, organizing, and distributing paperwork across all parties
- **Inspection scheduling** — coordinating inspections between buyers, sellers, and agents
- **Lender follow-ups** — checking on loan status, EMD receipts, and clear-to-close timelines
- **Closing preparation** — reviewing settlement statements and ensuring everything aligns with the original contract

In short, a TC does the critical but time-consuming work that keeps deals from falling apart.

## Why Agents Need Transaction Coordination

Here's the reality most agents don't talk about: administrative work kills deals.

A single missed deadline — an expired inspection contingency, a late disclosure, a forgotten HOA document — can delay or even destroy a transaction. And when you're juggling 3, 5, or 10 active deals at once, the odds of something slipping through the cracks go up exponentially.

The math is simple. Every hour you spend on coordination is an hour you're not spending on the activities that actually generate revenue: prospecting, showing homes, negotiating offers, and building client relationships.

**The top-producing agents in the industry all have one thing in common: they delegate coordination so they can focus on selling.**

## The Traditional TC Model (and Its Problems)

Historically, agents have had three options for transaction coordination:

### 1. Do It Yourself
Cost: $0 out of pocket, but enormous in time. Most agents who self-coordinate spend 5–8 hours per transaction on admin work. At 10 deals a month, that's a full-time job on top of your actual job.

### 2. Hire a Human TC
Cost: $300–$500 per transaction (sometimes more for complex deals). A good human TC is worth every penny — but the costs add up fast. Ten deals a month at $400 each is $4,000 in monthly overhead.

Human TCs also have inherent limitations. They work business hours. They get sick. They take vacations. And when they're handling multiple files simultaneously, response times slow down.

### 3. Use a TC Service Company
Cost: Similar to individual TCs, sometimes with volume discounts. TC companies can offer more consistency than solo operators, but they're still fundamentally limited by human capacity.

## How AI is Changing Transaction Coordination

This is where things get interesting.

AI-powered transaction coordinators like [Britanni AI](/features) are fundamentally rethinking how coordination works. Instead of relying on a human to manually track deadlines, send emails, and review documents, AI systems can:

- **Analyze contracts instantly** — extracting every critical date, amount, and contingency in under 60 seconds
- **Send communications automatically** — context-aware emails to the right parties at the right times
- **Track deadlines 24/7** — with automated reminders at configurable intervals before every critical date
- **Monitor inbound updates** — watching for EMD receipts, loan status changes, and title clearance
- **Scale effortlessly** — handling 1 deal or 100 deals with the same accuracy and speed

The result? Agents get better coordination at a fraction of the cost, with zero dropped balls.

## What to Look for in a TC Solution

Whether you choose a human TC, an AI-powered platform, or a hybrid approach, here's what matters:

1. **Reliability** — deadlines are non-negotiable. Your TC solution must track and remind without fail.
2. **Communication** — every party should be kept in the loop without you having to manually forward emails.
3. **Visibility** — you should be able to see the status of every deal at a glance.
4. **Cost-effectiveness** — the solution should pay for itself in time saved and deals protected.
5. **Ease of use** — if it takes longer to use the tool than to do the work, it's not worth it.

## The Bottom Line

Transaction coordination isn't optional — it's the backbone of every successful deal. The question isn't whether you need it, but how you get it.
