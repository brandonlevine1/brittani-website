Every real estate agent has a horror story about a missed deadline. Maybe it was an inspection contingency that expired while you were waiting for the buyer to decide. Maybe a financing deadline slipped because the lender was slow and nobody followed up. Or maybe an EMD wasn't deposited on time and the seller used it as an excuse to walk.

Whatever the specifics, the pattern is always the same: a critical date passes, someone drops the ball, and the deal is either dead or in serious jeopardy.

The good news? Missed deadlines are completely preventable. Here are the 5 deadlines that kill the most deals — and how to make sure you never miss one.

## 1. Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) Deadline

**Typical timeframe:** 1–3 days after contract execution

The EMD deposit is often the very first deadline in a transaction, and it's one of the most commonly missed. The buyer needs to deliver the earnest money to the escrow agent or title company within the timeframe specified in the contract.

**Why agents miss it:** In the excitement of getting a deal under contract, the administrative step of actually delivering the EMD gets pushed to "tomorrow." Then tomorrow becomes the day after. By then, you're in breach.

**How to never miss it:** Automated tracking should flag the EMD deadline the moment the contract is analyzed. The buyer, buyer's agent, and title company should all receive reminders. And when the title company confirms receipt, the system should log it and move on.

This is exactly how [Britanni AI handles EMD tracking](/features) — automatic extraction from the contract, reminders to all parties, and confirmation tracking with the title company.

## 2. Inspection Period Deadline

**Typical timeframe:** 10–15 days after contract execution (varies by state and contract)

The inspection period is one of the most critical windows in any transaction. The buyer has a finite number of days to conduct inspections, review results, and either accept the property as-is, negotiate repairs, or exercise their right to cancel.

**Why agents miss it:** Inspection scheduling involves coordinating across multiple parties — the buyer, seller, listing agent, and inspector. If scheduling takes too long, the inspection itself might not happen until the end of the window, leaving almost no time for repair negotiations. And if the deadline passes with no action, the buyer may lose their right to cancel.

**How to never miss it:** Start tracking the inspection deadline from day one. Proactively reach out to the buyer to schedule inspections early in the window. Send automatic reminders as the deadline approaches. And if repair negotiations are ongoing, flag the need for a deadline extension.

## 3. Financing Contingency Deadline

**Typical timeframe:** 20–30 days after contract execution

The financing contingency gives the buyer a specified number of days to secure their mortgage commitment. If the buyer can't get financing by the deadline, they can typically cancel without penalty. If the deadline passes and they stay in the deal, they may lose their ability to cancel over financing issues.

**Why agents miss it:** Loan processing happens outside the agent's direct control. The lender has their own timeline, and agents often don't hear about problems until it's too late. Without regular status checks, a financing issue can go undetected until past the contingency deadline.

**How to never miss it:** Implement weekly lender status checks starting from the first week of the deal. Track key milestones: appraisal ordered, appraisal completed, underwriting review, conditional approval, clear-to-close. If any milestone falls behind schedule, escalate immediately.

## 4. Title Clearance / HOA Document Deadline

**Typical timeframe:** Varies (often 5–15 days for HOA documents)

For properties in HOA or condo communities, there's typically a deadline for the buyer to receive and review governing documents, assessment amounts, and any pending litigation. If these documents aren't delivered on time, the buyer may have grounds to cancel.

**Why agents miss it:** HOA management companies are notoriously slow. Estoppel letters and governing documents can take weeks to arrive. If nobody is following up, the deadline passes and the deal is in limbo.

**How to never miss it:** Request HOA documents immediately after contract execution. Track the request and set escalating follow-up reminders at 3, 5, and 7 days. If documents haven't been received by the midpoint of the deadline, send an urgent follow-up.

## 5. Closing Date

**Typical timeframe:** 30–60 days after contract execution

The closing date is the ultimate deadline. Everything in the transaction is building toward this moment. But closings get delayed — frequently — and when they do, both parties can face consequences.

**Why agents miss it:** Death by a thousand cuts. Small delays throughout the process compound: a slow appraisal pushes the loan commitment back, which pushes the clear-to-close back, which means the closing statement isn't ready on time. By the time everyone realizes the closing date is at risk, there isn't enough time to course-correct.

**How to never miss it:** Track every upstream deadline and milestone that feeds into the closing date. Monitor lender progress weekly. Confirm title clearance early. Schedule the final walkthrough with enough buffer time. And if any upstream milestone slips, immediately assess the impact on closing.

## The Common Thread

Notice the pattern? Every missed deadline traces back to the same root causes:

1. **Lack of visibility** — the agent didn't know the deadline was approaching
2. **No follow-up system** — nobody checked on progress until it was too late
3. **Too many parties** — information was scattered across emails, texts, and phone calls

The solution isn't to work harder or "be more careful." The solution is to build a system that makes missing deadlines structurally impossible.

## Automate Your Deadline Tracking

If you're currently tracking deadlines in a spreadsheet, on sticky notes, or — worst of all — in your head, you're taking on unnecessary risk with every transaction.

AI-powered transaction coordination platforms like [Britanni AI](/features) extract every deadline from your contract automatically, send reminders to all parties at configurable intervals, and alert you the moment anything falls behind schedule.

The result? Zero missed deadlines. Every deal.
